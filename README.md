# Intro to Python for Data Challenge 2023 by CodeFirstGirls
In this challenge, you will be working with sales data for various products across different categories. This challenge is designed to help you develop your Python programming skills and give you valuable experience in data analysis.

## Challenge introduction
Imagine you work for a small company that sells products online. Your manager has asked you to analyse the sales data from the past year to determine which products are the best selling. You have also been asked to identify any trends in customer purchasing behaviour. 

Your task is to write a Python program that reads in a CSV file containing the sales data. You should  perform  the following tasks:

- Use Pandas to read in the sales data from the CSV file provided (sales_dataset.csv)
- Calculate the total sales for each product 
- Determine the average sale price for each product category 
- Identify the month with the highest sales and the month with the lowest sales
- Determine which customers made the most purchases and how much they spent in total
- Write the results of your analysis as a CSV file

## Requirements:

- The program should use functions to perform each of the required tasks
- The program should be well-commented and easy to read
- All teams should use the same dataset provided in the “student materials” folder on Slack 

## Optional extras:

- Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create detailed graphs of the sales data
- Calculate additional metrics (e.g. median sale price, standard deviation of sale prices)
